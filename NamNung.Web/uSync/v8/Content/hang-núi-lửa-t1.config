<h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
<p><strong>Lorem Ipsum</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
<p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
</div>
<p> </p>
<div>
<h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>
<p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.</p>

<p>Volcanic Cave T1</p>
<p>Geographic coordinates of the cave mouth: X: 12° 27′ 42.69276″ north latitude;</p>
<p>Y: 107° 56′ 59.8074″ east longitude.</p>
<p>Administrative location: Buon Choa'h commune, Krong No district, Dak Nong province.</p>

<p>Structure diagram of cave T1</p>
<p>The current morphology and structure of T1 cave is the result of the formation of volcanic caves through many eruption stages of Chu B'Luk volcano. Surveying and researching cave T1 have drawn some conclusions as follows:</p>
<p>+ The main lava flow, which is rich in gas, comes from Chu R'luh volcano in the northwest and flows down to the southeast, where the terrain is quite flat, made up of terrigenous rocks of the La Nga Formation;</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5006" src="http://daknonggeopark.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/T1-2.jpg" alt="Hang núi lửa T1" /></p>
<p>Volcanic Cave T1</p>
<p>– Because the terrain is not steep enough, even though it is near the volcano, in the first place, the lava flow does not have enough kinetic energy, in other words, the lava flow energy is not strong enough to form a large lava tube that has/only created small lava tubes with a common development direction of West - East. The formation of small lava tubes also participates in the process of local gas accumulation in the lava flow. The deep air cavities in the ceiling and walls of the T1 cave have proved this statement.</p>
<p><img class="wp-image-5007" src="http://daknonggeopark.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/T1-3.jpg" alt="Hang núi lửa T1" /></p>
<p>Volcanic Cave T1</p>
<p>- The lava flow of the next eruption phase with very low viscosity has crept into the cracks, the boundary between the rock layers flowing into the pre-existing cave, the lava flows into the cave according to different depths. each other: from the bottom to go up or from the upper floor, halfway up the cave. At the bottom, the lava flows up through cleft-shaped caves, while the lava flows from the top often create high floating mounds and mounds. The orientation of the flow is determined by high floating ledges in the form of convex incense arcs in the main cave or broken ledges (curtains) left by lava.</p>
<p>– Another difference between many other volcanic caves, maybe T1 cave is closer to the volcano or maybe the lava flow is flowing towards T1 cave a lot with high temperature, great pressure or it is also possible that the source of lava is at high temperature. Due to the greater depth, cave T1 has a large amount of lava flow when it flows into the cave (from the mouth of the cave) about 100m to the east, almost the top of the entire previous cave floor is up (as evidenced by the entire cave, so the cave is broken). formed into large raised boulders, so close to the old cave ceiling with a length of nearly 150m, Another difference is that the rock in the ceiling of the cave has a different composition than the living rock due to the new flow, which is solid basalt. This color is brown, while the newly formed rock is foam basalt and the surface usually has a hard and solid glass film.</p>
<p>– More notably, in the T1 cave near the end, a series of basalt rocks are formed in the knee-bridge style. on an area of ​​about 400m2 are round, sized, spherical basalts with D= 20-40cm. Their surface has a clear glass structure, which proves that basal is formed in the aquatic environment. Right next to the area with cubic basalt, so the cave is quite flat and has the shape of a basin with d=15m, most likely here before the lava flow was a small lake. That's why we meet the knee bridge basalt here.</p>
<p>- Lava tube. Up to this point, with 47 caves discovered in Buon Choa, no cave has been found that has ledges on both sides of the foot of the cave that are bent to form a round tube with a mineral diameter of 0.6-1.0m. is composed of many thin layers running on both sides of the cave floor, This can be explained as follows: due to the very high viscosity of the lava flow, the flow in the section with the barrier layer reduces the flow rate, creating great pressure, so when the lava flows out from the bottom of the cave with greater pressure and flow velocity, on both sides  (peripheral) of the flow the membranes  the two edges are cooled down not forming curved edges, but the degree of bending so large that it forms a round tube. – Lava trench, another difference is that, right from the entrance of the cave about 100m (starting to the cave floor is pushed up) on both sides of the cave there are no curved edges on either side, but here it forms a deep trench. looks like two trenches on both sides with a width of 0.5-1m, a depth of 20 nights 60cm.</p>]]></Value>
